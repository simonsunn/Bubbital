- Please run BBMain.java inside the "src" folder
- A compiled (Bubbital.jar) file is also provided for your easy access

- The "other" folder contains:
-- OBTest.java which is a program that we used to test collision
-- TransparentTest.java is the program we used to test how to draw transparent shapes (for the exploding bubbles)
--- source: http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=26349&seqNum=5&rll=1
-- Diagrams explain how we got the bounce angle (formulas will be handed in)

n0tes:
- the highscores can be reset by deleting the highscores.txt file and it will (auto-magically) create a new on
     the next time a highscore is saved
- images (the main menu turret, the seashells, the fishies) were from clker.com
- we will hand our worklogs on Wednesday January 25, 2012
- our AI isn't as smart as Watson (IBM) but it adds a twist
- we have spent countless hours playing->testing our game, so we doubt you can beat our highscores :)

Have fun and hope you like easter eggs!
